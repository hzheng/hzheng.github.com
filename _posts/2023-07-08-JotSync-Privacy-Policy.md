# Privacy Policy for JotSync

**Last Updated: July 8, 2023**

## 1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains how JotSync ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and protects information from and about you when you use the JotSync mobile and web application (the "App"). 

We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it through our compliance with this policy.

## 2. Information We Collect and How We Collect It

In the course of providing our App, we collect and receive the following types of information:

- **User Content:** This includes the links and content you save to our App. These are stored in our secure databases in order to provide the App's core services and ensure a seamless sync across your devices.
- **Device and Usage Information:** We may automatically collect certain information about the device you are using, including but not limited to your device type, operating system version, and App usage statistics.

Please note that we do not collect any personally identifiable information unless you expressly provide it to us.

## 3. How We Use Your Information

We use your information to provide, maintain, and improve our App and its functionalities. This includes using your saved links and content to sync across your devices. 

We do not share, sell, or disclose your information with third parties, except as described in this policy. 

Please be assured that as the developer, we don't inspect or use any of the data you save in the App beyond the provision of services.

## 4. How Your Information is Stored and Protected

We use Firebase, a leading cloud service provider, to securely store your data. Firebase provides robust data protection measures. However, please be aware that no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## 5. User Rights and Choices

You have the right to access the personal information we hold about you and to ask that this information be corrected, updated, or deleted. If you would like to exercise these rights, please contact us through the contact information below.

## 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage or sending you a notification).

Your continued use of the App after such update will constitute your acknowledgment of the modifications and your consent to abide and be bound by the modified Privacy Policy.
